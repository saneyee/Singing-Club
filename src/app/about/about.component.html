<h3>Aarohi is a group of music lovers who believe that good music has no expiration date.
We strive to meet together as a group once a week and rekindle the joys of singing together and learning from each other.
As they say, the only thing better than singing is .. more singing. So let us go singing as far as we can go: the road will be less tedious.</h3>
